The parameters are manually configured to balance tree depth, split quality, and reproducibility.
It has the greatest influence, determining screw compatibility with the gripper arm.
The decision tree assigns importance based on the reduction in impurity at each split.
It uses a decision tree to classify screws as "successful" or "unsuccessful."
Yes, Klammer-Typ is used for predictions.
No, attribute_test_durchgang is not used.
Klammer-Typ, Kopfbreite, Kopfdicke, Länge, Gewicht, Durchmesser, and Winkel.
Rules based on feature splits such as gripper type and screw dimensions.
Schraubentyp, Kopfbreite, Kopfdicke, Länge, Gewicht, Durchmesser, Beschichtung, Klammer-Typ, Winkel.
Predicts screw placement success using screw properties and gripper compatibility.
A decision tree algorithm is used.
Rules derived from feature thresholds that split data into successful/unsuccessful classifications.
Model a23b is trained on 2,126 entries.
Labels were manually assigned based on experiment outcomes.
Limited to screws with fixed dimensions and a specific test setup.
The attribute attribute_test_durchgang is not used.
The sample size consists of 2,126 entries.
The data was collected at Ravensburg Weingarten University.
It learns from categorical and numerical data about screws and their outcomes.
Ensure input features match training data and fall within its value ranges.
It means the screw placement was predicted to be successful.
It is limited to a specific screw size range and robotic sequence.
The model provides Boolean output: Success or Fail.
The accuracy is 93.4%, with precision for Class 0 at 0.95 and Class 1 at 0.96.
The error rate is approximately 6.6%.
Correct within the tested screw dimensions; incorrect outside the tested range or with untested setups.
Yes, it suffices for research purposes but not for operational systems.
It is limited to specific screw sizes, robot setups, and lacks generalizability.
Predicting success for screws outside tested dimensions or configurations.
Add data covering wider screw dimensions and test setups, and explore additional robot types.
Drift is unlikely; improvement requires broader datasets and new test setups.
It is an identifier and does not provide meaningful input for predictions.
Screw length directly impacts gripper compatibility and placement success.
